This dataset was created with the intention of training a machine-learning model to generate stereoscopic 3d image pairs. My plans are to first: grab tons of screenshot from various games in equal volume (1000 total images, 500 pairs) then, second: compile all of these images into a dataset by grouping pairs together as a single image and shuffling images together by game for maximum diversity.

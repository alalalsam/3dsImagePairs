This dataset was created with the intention of training a machine-learning model to generate stereoscopic 3d image pairs. My plans are to first: grab tons of screenshots from various games in equal volume (1000 total images, 500 pairs / game) then, second: compile all of these images into a dataset. This dataset will have the separate left and right stereo images combined into a single image, and the images shuffled between games to introduce variety from one screenshot to the next.

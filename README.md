This is a dataset that might be useful for models that predict a matching stereoscopic image pair from a single input image. 
What I plan on doing:
1.) Collect 500 image pairs (1000 screenshots total) from different 3ds games
2.) Combine the image pairs into a single image, with the left view on the left, and the right view on the right
3.) Shuffle all the screenshots from the various games together, to facilitate better training
